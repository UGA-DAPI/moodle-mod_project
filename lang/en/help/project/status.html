<p>Allows mapping task dependencies.</p>

<p>In a complex project, a task is likely to depend on previous
works being achieved, because what has been produced by the latter
is involved in the former.</p>

<p>the trask tree implicitely defines subtasks as mastering a
supertask, i.e., a supertask can be completed only after all
subtasks do. This defines an implicit dependency mapping that will
needs no special work. Thus the dependency mapping list will only
show tasks that are not in the same hierarchy subtree.</p>

<p>The project manager is featured with a circularity detection
function, who will avoid circular dependencies to be mapped. In
case circularity or interdependency has a sense (in real life),
designers will have to choose a predominant direction for
dependency.</p>

<p>Cicularity avoidness will also forbid a subtask being dependent
of any of its superstaks.</p>
