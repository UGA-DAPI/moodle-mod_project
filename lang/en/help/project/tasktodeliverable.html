<p>Tasks are performed in order to produce some concrete parts of
the project's goal. These identified products are so called
"deliverables".</p>

<p>This selector allows designating the deliverables the current
task is responsible of.</p>

propagated through the project data model, allowing, as an example,
to display the completion rate of some deliverables based on task
completion analysis.</p>

<p>A task can be assigned a milestone. When mapped to a milestone,
some constraints on deadlines are added. The task is known as
having to be completed BEFORE the milestone is over.</p>

controls and consistency checks on the schedule.</p>

$string['tasktospecification_help'] = '
<p>Task can be designated as realizing some subset of
specifications. A single task may realize multiple specifications,
if defined as a rather general task (e.g. : "make that software
component" is a quite undetailed task definition that can realize
an entire set of detailed specifications for that module).
Conversely, a set of tasks may be implied in the realization of a
single specification entry.</p>

<p>This selector allows mapping the current task to multiple
specification entries.</p>

teacher defined criteria set.</p>

<p>Teachers will setup the criteria with a relevant panel in the

Deleting a criterion will delete previous grades for this criterion

<p>If enabled, and visibility policy is rather liberal, ungrouped students should be able to
